# Topoisomerase_trial
This is a basic simulation of the Topoisomerase enzyme 

In this we randomly distribute catenations across a single strand of DNA to
  1. Compare it with the experimental model
  2. Use it to extract more data
  
Strick (2001) is used to compute number of cycles for a given force and ATP concentration
which is used to calculate probability to perform Monte Carlo Simulations
